# Readme-file-generator

## Task
The task was to build a working readme file generator that uses node prompts to collect the information that is needed to build the readme file and the it populates a new read me file with the information that was provided.

## The Project
For this project we needed to use node.js to create a readme file for the user, the user is promted with questions about their project and the readme file is generated based on the answers to those prompts. This generator can add elements like description, licenses, tests, installtion requirments and a few others. 

## Usage
This could be used to get a basic readme file together and then the user can edit the file once it has been created with the basic infromation the user gave to the generator.
